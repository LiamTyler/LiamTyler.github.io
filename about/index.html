      <h3>About Me</h3>
      <p>I am a second year masters student in computer science at the University of Minnesota - Twin Cities, and I will be graduating in the spring. My main interest is in computer graphics and game engine programming,  though I have experience in many areas.</p>
      <p>A little bit about me outside of work and school is that I am very passionate about rock climbing and running. I like to compete in rock climbing competitions and take lots of trips to climb outdoors whenever I can. In undergrad I was on the rock climbing team and was an officer for it my last year. I also worked at the front desk and routeset at the UMN rock wall because I liked it and the community so much. Similarly, I have always been a long distance runner at heart. I started racing when I was 10, and have only stopped due to various injuries, but always come back to it.
      <p>I am currently looking for full time jobs starting summer or fall 2020. Ideally as a graphics or game engine programmer, but I am certainly open for any related work. I would also be open to an internship instead of a full time job if there is no opening for a full time job. Please take a look at my resume and portfolio, and feel free to contact me by the email or phone number listed below.</p>
