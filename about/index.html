      <h3>About Me</h3>
      <p>I am a second year Masters student in Computer Science at the University of Minnesota - Twin Cities graduating in Spring 2020. My main interests are computer graphics and game engine programming.</p>
      <p>Something that sets me apart is my drive to be the best that I can be. There are many days where I code all day at work, come home, and continue coding on my own projects to learn more and improve. In school I hate the thought of skimming by with easy projects. I am always picking project topics that are new to me and routinely go back to try and make improvements on past projects. My ongoing personal project is a game engine. I am constantly thinking of how new features should be implemented, and redoing old sections as I learn more and more about this field through internships, classes, and personal exploration.</p>
      <p>When I am not programming, I enjoy outdoor activities, such as rock climbing and long distance running. As an undergraduate student I competed on the university's rock climbing team and was an officer my last year. Running has always been a part of my life; I started when I was 10 years old and ran competitively through most of my K-12 years. While injuries sometimes slow me down, I always return. Both of these activities have taught me the importance of persistence and practice-- skills that have served me well in and out of sports.</p>
      <p>I am currently looking for full time jobs in the areas of graphics or game engine programming starting Summer or Fall 2020. I am also open to positions and related fields and internships if no full time positions are available. Please look at my resume and portfolio, and feel free to contact me by the email or phone number listed below.</p>
