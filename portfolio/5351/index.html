      <h1 class="centerText">Real Time Ray Tracing</h1>
      <hr>
      <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>For the final project, I chose to implement a Cuda ray tracer that allowed a user to walk through a scene in real time. I uses bounding volume heirarchies (BVHs) as well as several other optimizations to enable rendering of scenes with millions of triangles in just a few milliseconds. This, combined with ability for objects to be both reflective and refractive, makes it a lot better than the last ray tracer I made.</p>
      <h2>Code</h2>
      <p>Code from this project can be found in <a href="https://github.com/LiamTyler/realtime-cuda-raytracer">this GitHub repo</a>. The code is written in Cuda and C++ and it was built on top of my game engine <a href="https://liamtyler.github.io/portfolio/Progression/index.html">Progression</a> to help with things like windowing, input handling, and scene loading.</p>

      <h2>Features</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Real-time 3D ray tracer</li>
        <li>BVH traversal of triangle meshes</li>
        <li>Optimized ray shape intersection tests</li>
        <li>First person camera to move through the scene</li>
        <li>Blinn phong shading</li>
        <li>Skybox support</li>
        <li>Limited support for dynamic objects</li>
        <li>Tracing of spheres and triangle meshes</li>
        <li>Scene loading from text files</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Controls</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>WASD/Mouse:</strong> Camera control</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Implementation Details</h2>
      <p>For more details on the performance and optimizations I did, take a look at the report I had to write on the project <a href="Liam-Tyler-5351-Report.pdf" download>here.</a></p>

      <h2>Future work</h2>
      <p>I was really happy that the BVH enabled the scene to have millions of triangles in it, but one of the biggest limiting factors is that there is no BVH for the whole scene. Since the scene is dynamic, a new BVH would have to be created or updated every frame in just a few milliseconds. I did not have time to tackle this issue, but it would be the next major step. Another thing is that currently no anti-aliasing is done. This is fairly noticeable when looking at edges while the camera is moving, and on the very tiny triangles of the Buddha model.</p>
