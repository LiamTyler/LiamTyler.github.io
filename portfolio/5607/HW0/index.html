      <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>The goal of this assignment was primarly to get OpenGL and SDL2 compiled and running. Full points were given if you drew a single square that you could translate, scale, and rotate with your mouse. I ended up taking it a step further and doing a lot of extra things. See the features section for the details.</p>
      <h2>Difficulties</h2>
      <p>The main difficulties I ran into were using OpenGL by itself. I've used OpenGL before, but it's always been abstracted away into nice classes where I only have to know the concepts. This is the first time I have had to do all the nitty gritty things myself. We also haven't learned about most of this, so I had to look up a lot of things, like vaos, vbos, and how to do post-processing things like the edge detection. The edge detection was probably the most difficult. I did it by having one square that is textured as monalisa. I render that square / screen to a framebuffer, and then texture square #2 by sending the framebuffer's texture through a different fragment shader that I wrote to do the edge detection.</p>

      <h2>Tools Used</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Modern OpenGL 3 for drawing and shading</li>
        <li>SDL2 for the windowing and user input</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Features</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Variable number of squares and triangles</li>
        <li>Each object can be translated, scaled, and rotated</li>
        <li>Each object can be textured</li>
        <li>If an object is not textured, it turns green when translating, red when rotating, and purple when scaling</li>
        <li>Edge detection shader (see monalisa square)</li>
        <li>Animation (press spacebar to rotate monalisa)</li>
        <li>Background change (press b)</li>
        <li>Maintaining object shape and size when window is scaled</li>
        <li>Can uncomment and recompile for emboss filter as well (see buildings pic)</li>
      </ul>
