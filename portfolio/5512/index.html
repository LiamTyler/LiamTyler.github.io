      <hr>
      <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>The goal of this project was to get an AI to teach itself how to play the old classic Atari game Pong. I chose to do this as a final project because I was fascinated when I saw this video: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qv6UVOQ0F44">MarI/O</a>, where an AI teaches itself how to play Super Mario World. I had never done anything related to this before, so I chose to do the same thing but for an easier game: Pong. The technique I chose to use was Deep Q-Learning, which is a type of reinforcement learning. The AI sees the image of the game at each frame, as well as when it scores or gets scored on. It doesn't know what up or down is, or that the ball bounces off the paddle and walls, or even that there is a ball. Using the algorithm though, it learns the association it's actions have on its score. After playing a couple thousand games, it learns well enough what actions will cause it to score, and start always winning the game.</p>

      <h2>Difficulties</h2>
      <p>I had a lot of difficulties with simply getting things to run correctly. I never did find the bug, but I found out having a non-square input images to the neural-network caused a huge memory leak on my machine, running out after a few minutes. This limited my final results, as it takes hours to train the network. The other main difficulty was was my prior lack of knowledge; I had never done any machine learning or reinforcement learning project before, so it was a lot to figure out. There is a lot of very small things that can have a large impact on the results.</p>

      <h2>Implementation Details</h2>
      <p>For more details on the performance and optimizations I did, take a look at the report I had to write on the project <a href="5512_Final_Paper.pdf" download>here.</a></p>

      <h2>Tools Used</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Keras + Tensorflow for the machine learning part</li>
        <li>OpenAI gym for the pong game, and easy access to the game's state</li>
      </ul>
