      <description>Asset pipelines are one of the pieces of game development I don&amp;rsquo;t see people talk about very often. The main concepts are often introduced and chatted about theoretically, sure: &amp;ldquo;convert your assets into binary packages, compress them, and load them at runtime,&amp;rdquo; but rarely do I find people chatting about the implementation details. It always strikes me as a little odd, because I&amp;rsquo;d argue it has the single biggest impact on development.</description>

      <title>Generating Height Maps From Normal Maps</title>

      <description>In this post, I want to explain how to take a normal map and generate its corresponding height map (also called displacement map). There are multiple ways to achieve this, but the one I&amp;rsquo;ll be covering in this post is the method that Danny Chan presented in Advances in Real Time Rendering at Siggraph 2018 (link here, page 16). It&amp;rsquo;s also the same method that the Call of Duty engine still uses today to generate the vast majority of its height maps.</description>
