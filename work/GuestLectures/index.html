      <h2>1113: Intro to C++</h2>
      <p>One of the semesters I was a TA for this class, the professor said he would let a TA give a lecture if he or she wanted to. I thought it would be a good learning experience, and took him up on the offer. The students were just getting to memory and dynamic allocation, so that is what I gave my lecture on. I found out I really like teaching and lecturing actually.</p>

      <h2>5607: Graphics 1</h2>
      <p>I did an independent study one semester with the professor who was also teaching Graphics 1 that semester. As part of my independent study, he wanted me to give a lecture on what I had been working on that semester, and help design a final project for students to do if they were interested. My independent study that semester had been on rendering pipelines and a couple game engine related things. My lecture had several live demos, but it was on forward, deferred, and tiled deferrend rendering, ECS architecture, and resource optimization. I had a blast giving this lecture, though I wish I could redo it, since I know a lot more about all those topics now.</p>
