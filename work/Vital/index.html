      <h2>Regression Testing Framework</h2>
      <p>Vital takes the results of scans such as MRI and CT scans, and builds 3D volumes that users can view and interact with. For the past 20 years though, they had never had a good and consistent way to test the volume building. Developers would continually create new tools when new features / versions came out. This framework that my mentor and I built allows developers to embed what is essentially a logger into their code. They specify the results that are important to record, and then the logger would record this, and send it to a backend, compare it against previous versions of the code, and generate a webpage displaying the results of test. It was very hassle free for the users, and was generic enough to be used on many existing projects, and hopefully many future ones. We made heavy use of c++ templates and flatbuffers to log the results, and get their values on a backend later for comparison.</p>
      <p></p>
      <h2>Tools Used</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Heavy use of c++ templates</li>
        <li>Flatbuffers for data serialization</li>
        <li>Docker for running the backend</li>
        <li>CMake for compilation and building on Windows, Linux, and Mac</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Features</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Templated API that is very user friendly</li>
        <li>Serialization and posting to a backend</li>
        <li>Cross platform compatibility</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Volume Comparison Tool</h2>
      <p>Vital's application features many volume algoritms. For example, if you are looking at a scan of the chest, you could run an algorithm to segment out the heart, since that's the part you are currently interested in viewing. For the developers that work on those algorithms, they want to know when they come out with a new version of the algorithm, how it differs from the old one. The tool they had to do this comparison was over a decade old, using OpenGL 1. I redid the whole thing to use OpenGL 4, have a user interface, support much larger volumes, and added features to further enhance the comparison.</p>
      <h2>Tools Used</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>OpenGL for the rendering</li>
        <li>Nanogui for the windowing and UI</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Features</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Interactive volume comparison of volumes up to around 10GB in size</li>
        <li>User interface for exploring the volumes and their differences</li>
      </ul>
