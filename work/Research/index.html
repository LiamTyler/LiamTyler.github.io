      <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>Some of the biologists here at the UMN are doing research on how cancer cells migrate throughout the body. They created a new motor-clutch model and wrote a 2D simulator for it in Matlab. The problem however, was that simulating 8 hours took about 17 hours in real life. They hired me to rewrite the code in C++ and speed it up.</p>
      <h2>Results</h2>
      <p>During the summer of 2017 I worked on converting the simulator. I got it to simulate 8 hours in about a half hour of real time. This was a ~30x speed up. There was still a lot of room for optimization, but this was a good enough speed up to shift gears. In the fall I worked with the visualization professor in the computer science department. We worked on a tool that would help visualize and understand the model, because in a lot of ways, the model the biologists came up with was still a black box with a lot of things to learn from it still. Eventually this project got handed off to one of the PhD students in the Viz lab.</p>

      <h2>Simulator Features</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Can switch between 1D and 2D easily</li>
        <li>Highly extensible, which will make adding 3D in the future much easier</li>
        <li>Uses a GSL non-linear equation solver to do force balance on all of the cell arms</li>
        <li>Can easily switch into testing framework, where you can load up the exact same random numbers into both the C++ and Matlab versions, and then directly compare their states after each event. I made sure my code lined up to the 14th decimal point after 10,000 events.</li>
