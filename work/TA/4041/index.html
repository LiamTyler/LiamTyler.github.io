      <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>I was a TA for this class my first semester of grad school. I actually put this class on the list while applying because I didn't feel like I was very good at algorithms and proofs. TAing for this class would force me to get a lot better at it, which it did. My main responsibilities were to give a couple hours of recitations every week, provide help at office hours, and help grade all of the written assignments.</p>
