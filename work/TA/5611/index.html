      <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>I was a TA for this class my second semester of grad school. This class was really fun to TA for because I had taken it the previous spring, and really enjoyed the projects we did in that class (the particle system, cloth, and crowd simulation, as seen in my portfolio). My main responsibilities were to provide help at office hours, and grade.</p>
