      <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>The main thing I worked on at Activision was porting the game engine to IOS. The company was pretty interested in exploring the possibility of getting things running on mobile devices. I worked a lot on automatic shader translation, shader reflection, adding compute shader support, memory optimization, as well as plenty of various little things. I had never worked with Metal or IOS before, so it was quite a bit to learn. I also worked a few weeks on a in house GPU frame capture tool for the PS4, which is very similar to RenderDoc. Overall I had a blast working here and definitely want to stay in the game industry.</p>
